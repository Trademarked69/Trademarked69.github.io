**[R-YaTian](https://github.com/R-YaTian) has made a better fork of this [here](https://github.com/R-YaTian/3ds-battery-patches)**  
3DS home menu battery patches for USA EUR and JPN. Supports 11.17.0-50U, 11.17.0-50J, and 11.17.0-50E. StatusBatPercent replaces date in statusbar with battery percent. StatusBatIcon makes the battery icon display each bar as 25% of battery charge. Both should do both.
