### UndertaleNoBorder=Fullscreen v2
[Download/Install instructions](https://github.com/Trademarked69/Misc.-Vita-stuff/releases/tag/UndertaleNoBorder%3DFullscreenV2)  
**Must use the North American (PCSE01116) or European (PCSB01157) version of Undertale and must have repatch.**  
Does what the title says, changes the none border to make the game take up the full screen like it does on pc. v1 was experimental and was based on the release version so I won't post it here.
